Template customization
======================

It is possible to use your own template for customization and branding.  For
this place a file called "remark.html" in the same location as the Markdown
file which contains your slides. If such a file exists, it will be used instead
of the `default template
<https://github.com/bast/cicero/blob/master/cicero/templates/remark.html>`_.
Make sure to use the variables "title", "markdown", and "style" in your custom
template.  Apart from that you have full liberty to employ own CSS and
JavaScript.
